                <p>I had a great premade group (same people I did 1531 with), and although the course was definitely intense, it was also very rewarding to see us progress through and look back on our work at the end.

                    Be prepared for a lot of work. I did it with 2 other courses and was *ok*, wouldn't recommend taking anything else that's too heavy with it though.
                    
                    Most students should probably underload to 2 subjects OR do a gen ed or something so you don't go too crazy.</p>

                <p>Honestly, if you work hard each week to learn the content and engage with it through practice/effort, you'll genuinely be ok for this course. Exam can be somewhat tough, but as a whole I actually really enjoyed it lol</p>

                <p class="text">I took this course in 22T1 and really loved the course. It was a nice breath of fresh air during the term compared to the other courses I was taking. I highly recommend that CSE students take this course as an elective as any skills with databases will be useful, and the course can be a nice breather compared to the increasing difficulty of other level 3+ courses.

                    Lectures: Dong Wen was the lecturer this term, and he did a really good job explaining the course content and a clear and concise manner.
                    
                    Tutorials: The tutorials are a solid 90 minutes of going over the course content and solving questions as a class with the tutor. 
                    <span class="dots">  ...</span>
                    <span class="extraText">
                    My tutor was really good at explaining the concepts, so I always walked out of the tutorial feeling confident in what I had learned.
                    
                    Quizzes: The 6 quizzes that were required during the term took all of 5 minutes to complete. 4 questions each, not too tricky, nice.
                    
                    Assignments: The assignments actually felt fairly small and easy to work through. The first was 6 SQL and 4 coding questions, and the second was 4 Python questions. Extremely doable assignments for students of all levels.
                    
                    Exam: The final exam was the hardest part of the course, funnily enough. It was still a very doable exam, and the 4 hour time limit was greatly appreciated to be able to attempt all of the questions.

                <p>This course has far too much content in it. I really did enjoy all the work on OOP and design patterns (which I've already applied to many of my own projects), and the assignment was by far the coolest project I've worked on at university, but it was just so much to handle. I feel like they need to cut back on the specifications for the assignment a lot, and take a few parts of the course out (concurrency can be covered in other courses), and reconsider the difficulty of their final exam, which was nearly impossible.

                    I think this course is a necessity for anyone that wants to do anything in an OOP paradigm, and has a huge amount of potential to be one of the best courses that UNSW has to offer, but as of 21T3 it was still in need of some major refactoring to fix its numerous design smells.</p>
